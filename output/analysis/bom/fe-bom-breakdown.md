> A frontend story is **Done only after every backend story it depends on has been delivered**. Full story text (objectives, required changes, AC, testing) lives in fe-08-frontend-stories.md — the hand-authored source of truth; this page is the per-domain planning view.

## What Are We Changing?

- Point the **BOM** GraphQL operations in `pdex-ui-react` at the federated router (subgraph `plm-product (co-located)`) behind the platform feature flag, then remove legacy-gateway assumptions (typenames, cache keys, fragments).
- Cutover is per-domain and reversible: dual-run first, flag flip after parity, legacy path kept until the exit criterion holds.

## Recommended Implementation Order

> Staged from each story's dependencies: the backend phase its BE stories sit in (reads → search → writes → sagas) plus in-domain FE→FE chains. **Stories in the same step are independent of each other and parallelize.** ADR ratifications are entry gates, not ordering edges.

| Step | Stories (parallel set) | Waits for | Focus |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 🔴 `BOM-FE-001`, 🟢 `BOM-FE-004` | `BOM-FE-004` → `BOM-BE-B-05`, `BOM-BE-B-06`, `BOM-BE-B-07`, `BOM-BE-B-08` | Reads cutover — needs backend phase A/B reads live |
| 2 | 🔴 `BOM-FE-002`, 🟡 `BOM-FE-005` | `BOM-FE-002` → `BOM-BE-B-01`, `BOM-BE-B-03`, `BOM-BE-B-04`<br>`BOM-FE-005` → `BOM-BE-C-03`, `BOM-BE-C-04`, `BOM-BE-C-05` | Search & listing — needs backend phase C |
| 4 | 🟢 `BOM-FE-007` | `BOM-FE-007` → `BOM-BE-G-17` | Complex writes / sagas — needs backend phase E + ADR ratification |
| 5 | 🔴 `BOM-FE-003`, 🔴 `BOM-FE-006` | `BOM-FE-003` → `BOM-BE-C-01`, `BOM-BE-S-03`<br>`BOM-FE-006` → `BOM-BE-D-01`, `BOM-BE-D-03`, `BOM-BE-D-04`, `BOM-BE-D-05` (+1) | Externally gated — search/read-hub decision |

**Cutover flow:** `BOM-FE-001` → `BOM-FE-004` → `BOM-FE-002` → `BOM-FE-005` → `BOM-FE-007` → `BOM-FE-003` → `BOM-FE-006`.

## Recommended Story Graph — 1 Frontend Engineer

> The staged order map above, run by **one frontend engineer**. Steps re-sync at each stage because the stage's **backend gate** — not engineer availability — is the limiter.

| Step | 👤 FE-1 | Backend gate (focus) |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | 🔴 `BOM-FE-001` (3–4d)<br>🟢 `BOM-FE-004` (2–3d) | Reads cutover — needs backend phase A/B reads live |
| 2 | 🔴 `BOM-FE-002` (6–10d)<br>🟡 `BOM-FE-005` (3–5d) | Search & listing — needs backend phase C |
| 4 | 🟢 `BOM-FE-007` (2–4d) | Complex writes / sagas — needs backend phase E + ADR ratification |
| 5 | 🔴 `BOM-FE-006` (8–12d)<br>🔴 `BOM-FE-003` (5–8d) | Externally gated — search/read-hub decision |

**Elapsed (nominal midpoints):** ~38 FE build days — calendar time is set by the backend gates, not FE capacity.
