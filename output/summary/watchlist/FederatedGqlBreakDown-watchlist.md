#### What Are We Building?

- We are moving the **Watchlist** domain — quality watchlist entries on a product (reasons, statuses, inspections, partners, attachments) — off the `spark-internal-graphql` gateway into the **`plm-product`** DGS.
- It is **small and mid-low risk**: 4 queries, 3 mutations, 13 field resolvers on a 129-line resolver, with **no polymorphism**.
- It is **co-located** in the product family, so `Product.watchlists` and the TechPack `ResourcesCount.watchlists` count resolve **internally** (not across the federation gateway).

The one genuinely harder piece is **`updateWatchlistEntries`**, a multi-step write (user-group upsert, then
the body, then attachment archival) that today **does not await** its per-entry user-group updates — a race
to fix on the port.

**ACL note:** the current code obtains per-resource capability tokens via ACL. Per **ADR-019** ([`complexStories/acl/01-adr-acl-mid-request-update.md`](https://github.com/XXX/blob/main/output/complexStories/acl/01-adr-acl-mid-request-update.md)), permission-check and own-domain-token call sites stay resolver-local (context-only, unchanged); downstream-token call sites (e.g. the attachment-archive step in `updateWatchlistEntries`) use **Mid-Request ACL Update** before the downstream call.

---

#### Migration Scope

| Surface | Count | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Queries | 4 | 2 cacheable master-data; 1 four-step filtered read |
| Mutations | 3 | 2 simple + `updateWatchlistEntries` (multi-step) |
| Field-resolver type blocks | 3 | `Watchlist` (10), inspection (2), partner (1) |
| External dependencies | 6 keys (2 🔴 · 2 🟡 · 2 🔵) | search/attachment 🔴 |
| Federation contributions | 2 (Product, ResourcesCount) | **internal** (co-located) |
| **Total stories** | **13** | green-field |

---

#### Spikes & Complex Cases

> This domain's complex, cross-cutting problems are tracked once as **program spikes** in the global breakdown — see **Phase 0 — Program Spikes** (the table) and **Spike Detail** (the brief, the decision, intended cross-domain steps, and every affected resolver's external deps + current logic) in the "Federated+Graphql+Stories+-+BreakDown" overview. Nothing from there is repeated here; the stories below just **link** to it.

**Spike-gated stories in this domain** — each is flagged 🔴🔬 in its phase table with the same id in `Depends On`. *(Engineer: follow the id to the global **Spike Detail** for the target flow + the external services each resolver calls. See **How to read the spikes & related stories** in the global doc.)*

| Story | Program spike | Bucket |
|---|---|---|
| 🔴🔬 `WATCHLIST-BE-E-01` — `updateWatchlistEntries` (multi-step write) | `SPIKE-01` | Non-Atomic Write Saga |

> Follow a story's `SPIKE-0x` id to the global **Spike Detail** for its brief, steps and cross-service resolver breakdown.

> Simple, intuitive decisions (drift-op cleanup, dead-method audits, auth-token parity, sort/DTO shape) are resolved inline in the owning story — they are **not** spikes.

#### Effort Snapshot

| Phase | Name | Stories | Effort (est., +20% buffer) |
|-------|------|---------|----------------------------|
| B | Core Reads | 3 | 4–7d |
| C | Search & Listing | 1 | 2–5d |
| D | Mutations | 2 | 5–10d |
| E | Complex Operations | 1 | 5–8d |
| F | Federation & Stitching | 2 | 2–5d |
| G | Field Resolvers & Tests | 4 | 7–14d |
| **Total** | | **13** | **25–49d** (buffered) |

> Computed live from `be-04-stories.md` (phase + complexity per story) — always reconciles with the story tables below and the program overview. Effort = sum of per-story nominal day-ranges (Low 1–2 · Medium 2–4 · High 4–7 · Very High 7–12) × 1.2 buffer, AI-estimated — confirm in refinement. See each story's **Depends On** column for real sequencing.


**Capacity Planning**

| Team size | Calendar | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 1 engineer | ~6–11 sprints | sequential |
| 2 engineers | ~4–6 sprints | reads + mutations parallel after B-01 |

---

#### Recommended Sprint Sequencing

| Sprint | Stories | Focus |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | B-01 (DGS module init + service wiring + first resolver) | schema, service port, reads |
| 2 | C-01 + D-01/D-02 | filtered read + simple mutations |
| 3 | E-01 + F-01/F-02 | multi-step update + Product/TechPack internal contributions |
| 4 | G-01–G-03, G-05 (recommended, PO-gated) | field resolvers. Test coverage/parity tracked outside this Jira pipeline, created manually. |

---

#### Recommended Implementation Order

> Derived from each story's `Depends On` edges (plus the module-init scaffold as the implicit first step). A story appears in the earliest step where everything it depends on is already done; **stories in the same step are independent of each other and parallelize across engineers**. **Focus** names the phase category each step advances — same convention as the frontend order map.

> 🔬 spike gates and ⛔ cross-subgraph blocks are *entry criteria*, not ordering edges — a gated story slides later without reshuffling the map.

| Step | Stories (parallel set) | Entry gates in this step | Focus |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 🟢 `B-01` | — | 🧱 Module init — schema skeleton, service wiring (unblocks everything) |
| 2 | 🟢 `B-02`, 🟢 `B-03`, 🟡 `C-01`, 🟡 `D-01`, 🟡 `D-02`, 🟠 `E-01`, 🟢 `F-01`, 🟢 `F-02`, 🟢 `G-01`, 🟡 `G-02`, 🟡 `G-03` | `E-01` → 🔬 SPIKE-01 · ⛔ BLOCKED-BY product (PRODUCT-BE-E-00, the shared WriteSaga module) | Fan-out — 📖 Core Reads · 🔍 Search & Listing · ✏️ Mutations · ⚙️ Complex Operations · 🔗 Federation & Stitching · 🧪 Field Resolvers & Tests |
| 3 | 🟢 `G-05` | — | 🧪 Field Resolvers & Tests |

**Critical path:** `B-01` → `G-02` → `G-05` — 3 sequential stories; everything else hangs off this chain in parallel.

---

#### Recommended Story Graph — 1 Backend Engineer

> The order map above assumes unlimited parallelism; this packs the **same dependency graph onto 1 backend engineer** (greedy critical-chain scheduling, nominal day-ranges from complexity — confirm in refinement). Read each column top-to-bottom as one engineer's queue; ⏳ marks a slot that waits on a dependency, 🔬/⛔ are entry gates that slide a slot without reshuffling the lanes.

| Slot | 👤 BE-1 |
|---|---|
| 1 | 🟢 `B-01` (1–2d) |
| 2 | 🟠 `E-01` (4–7d) 🔬 ⛔ |
| 3 | 🟡 `G-02` (2–4d) |
| 4 | 🟡 `C-01` (2–4d) |
| 5 | 🟡 `D-01` (2–4d) |
| 6 | 🟡 `D-02` (2–4d) |
| 7 | 🟡 `G-03` (2–4d) |
| 8 | 🟢 `B-02` (1–2d) |
| 9 | 🟢 `B-03` (1–2d) |
| 10 | 🟢 `F-01` (1–2d) |
| 11 | 🟢 `F-02` (1–2d) |
| 12 | 🟢 `G-01` (1–2d) |
| 13 | 🟢 `G-05` (1–2d) |

**BE-1:** `B-01` → `E-01` → `G-02` → `C-01` → `D-01` → `D-02` → `G-03` → `B-02` → `B-03` → `F-01` → `F-02` → `G-01` → `G-05`

**Elapsed (nominal midpoints):** ~31 working days.

#### Jira Stories by Phase

> Each row is one Jira story. Complexity drives T-shirt sizing in refinement. `Depends On` lists blocking story IDs within this domain — including Phase 0 spikes where a story's implementation is gated on a spike's outcome.

---

#### What Are We Changing?

- Point the **Watchlist** GraphQL operations in `pdex-ui-react` at the federated router (subgraph `plm-product (co-located)`) behind the platform feature flag, then remove legacy-gateway assumptions (typenames, cache keys, fragments).
- Cutover is per-domain and reversible: dual-run first, flag flip after parity, legacy path kept until the exit criterion holds.

#### Stories

| Story | Title | Type | Impact | Effort | Depends on | Operations |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `WATCHLIST-FE-001` | Migrate watchlist reads | Query migration | 🟢 Low | 2–3 days | `WATCHLIST-BE-B-01`, `WATCHLIST-BE-C-01`, `WATCHLIST-BE-G-01`, `WATCHLIST-BE-G-02`, `WATCHLIST-BE-G-03`, `WATCHLIST-BE-G-05` | `getWatchlistByIds`, `getWatchlistByFilter` |

#### Recommended Implementation Order

> Staged from each story's dependencies: the backend phase its BE stories sit in (reads → search → writes → sagas) plus in-domain FE→FE chains. **Stories in the same step are independent of each other and parallelize.** ADR ratifications are entry gates, not ordering edges.

| Step | Stories (parallel set) | Waits for | Focus |
|---|---|---|---|
| 3 | 🟢 `WATCHLIST-FE-002` | `WATCHLIST-FE-002` → `WATCHLIST-BE-D-01`, `WATCHLIST-BE-D-02` | Writes — needs backend phase D mutations |
| 4 | 🟢 `WATCHLIST-FE-001`, 🟡 `WATCHLIST-FE-003` | `WATCHLIST-FE-001` → `WATCHLIST-BE-B-01`, `WATCHLIST-BE-C-01`, `WATCHLIST-BE-G-01`, `WATCHLIST-BE-G-02` (+2)<br>`WATCHLIST-FE-003` → `WATCHLIST-BE-E-01` | Complex writes / sagas — needs backend phase E + ADR ratification |

**Cutover flow:** `WATCHLIST-FE-002` → `WATCHLIST-FE-001` → `WATCHLIST-FE-003`.

---

#### Recommended Story Graph — 1 Frontend Engineer

> The staged order map above, run by **one frontend engineer**. Steps re-sync at each stage because the stage's **backend gate** — not engineer availability — is the limiter.

| Step | 👤 FE-1 | Backend gate (focus) |
|---|---|---|
| 3 | 🟢 `WATCHLIST-FE-002` (2–3d) | Writes — needs backend phase D mutations |
| 4 | 🟡 `WATCHLIST-FE-003` (3–4d)<br>🟢 `WATCHLIST-FE-001` (2–3d) | Complex writes / sagas — needs backend phase E + ADR ratification |

**Elapsed (nominal midpoints):** ~8 FE build days — calendar time is set by the backend gates, not FE capacity.
