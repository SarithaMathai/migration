## What Are We Building?

We are moving the **ProductDetails** domain — the product's "construction" sets (build/assembly detail rows,
their attachments, and per-partner access) — off the `spark-internal-graphql` gateway into the
**`plm-product`** DGS. It is **mid-sized and mid-low risk**: 2 queries, 6 mutations, 12 field resolvers on a
129-line resolver, with **no polymorphism**. (In the backend this domain is called *construction* —
`construction/v1`; the GraphQL names stay `productDetails`.)

The one genuinely harder piece is **`updateProductDetailsSet`**, a multi-step write — workspace
associations, then bulk-archive removed attachments, then the body — with no rollback today.

**ACL note:** the current code obtains per-resource capability tokens via ACL; Per the program-level working decision, **the DGS layer carries no ACL plumbing story** — each domain service performs its own access control; scenario ADRs ([`complexStories/*/02-adr-noacl-*.md`](https://github.com/XXX/blob/main/output/complexStories/*/02-adr-noacl-*.md)) record the assumption's impact and ratify with the global decision. ACL is noted in stories for context only.

## Migration Scope

| Surface | Count | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Queries | 2 | one by-ids (internal), one elastic (🔴 search) |
| Mutations | 6 | 5 simple + `updateProductDetailsSet` (multi-step) |
| Field-resolver type blocks | 3 | `ProductDetails` (10), item (2), category (1) |
| External dependencies | 6 keys (2 🔴 · 2 🟡 · 2 🔵) | search/attachment 🔴 |
| Federation contributions | 1 (Product) | **internal** (co-located) |
| **Total stories** | **13** | green-field |

## Spikes & Complex Cases

> This domain's complex, cross-cutting problems are tracked once as **program spikes** in the global breakdown — see **Phase 0 — Program Spikes** (the table) and **Spike Detail** (the brief, the decision, intended cross-domain steps, and every affected resolver's external deps + current logic) in the "Federated+Graphql+Stories+-+BreakDown" overview. Nothing from there is repeated here; the stories below just **link** to it.

**Spike-gated stories in this domain** — each is flagged 🔴🔬 in its phase table with the same id in `Depends On`. *(Engineer: follow the id to the global **Spike Detail** for the target flow + the external services each resolver calls. See **How to read the spikes & related stories** in the global doc.)*

| Story | Program spike | Bucket |
|---|---|---|
| 🔴🔬 `PDTL-BE-E-01` — `updateProductDetailsSet` (multi-step write) | `SPIKE-01` | Non-Atomic Write Saga |

> Follow a story's `SPIKE-0x` id to the global **Spike Detail** for its brief, steps and cross-service resolver breakdown.

> Simple, intuitive decisions (drift-op cleanup, dead-method audits, auth-token parity, sort/DTO shape) are resolved inline in the owning story — they are **not** spikes.

## Effort Snapshot

| Phase | Name | Stories | Effort (est., +20%) |
|---|---|---|---|
| B | Core Reads | 1 | 1–2d |
| C | Search & Listing | 1 | 2–4d |
| D | Mutations (simple) | 5 | 7–12d |
| E | Complex (`updateProductDetailsSet`) | 1 | 4–7d |
| F | Federation (Product, internal) | 1 | 1–2d |
| G | Field Resolvers & Tests | 4 | 9–15d |
| **Total** | | **13** | **24–42d** (buffered) |

> One engineer ≈ **5–9 sprints**.


> **Self-contained story model.** The DGS-on-REST framework already exists; every operation story is **end-to-end in one PR** — schema (query/mutation + the GraphQL types it returns) + DGS data fetcher + Kotlin REST service method (read/write) + push the schema change to **Hive**. The standalone `*Service` Kotlin-port story has been dissolved into the operation stories.


**Capacity Planning**

| Team size | Calendar | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 1 engineer | ~6–11 sprints | sequential |
| 2 engineers | ~4–6 sprints | reads + mutations parallel after B-01 |

---

## Recommended Sprint Sequencing

| Sprint | Stories | Focus |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | B-01 (DGS module init + service wiring + first resolver) | schema, service port, reads |
| 2 | D-01–D-05 | simple mutations |
| 3 | E-01 + F-01 | multi-step write + Product field |
| 4 | G-01–G-03 | field resolvers |
| 5 | G-04 | tests & parity |

## Recommended Implementation Order

> Derived from each story's `Depends On` edges (plus the module-init scaffold as the implicit first step). A story appears in the earliest step where everything it depends on is already done; **stories in the same step are independent of each other and parallelize across engineers**. **Focus** names the phase category each step advances — same convention as the frontend order map.

> 🔬 spike gates and ⛔ cross-subgraph blocks are *entry criteria*, not ordering edges — a gated story slides later without reshuffling the map.

| Step | Stories (parallel set) | Entry gates in this step | Focus |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 🟢 `B-01` | — | 🧱 Module init — schema skeleton, service wiring (unblocks everything) |
| 2 | 🟡 `C-01`, 🟡 `D-01`, 🟡 `D-02`, 🟡 `D-04`, 🟠 `E-01`, 🟢 `F-01`, 🟡 `G-01`, 🟡 `G-02`, 🟡 `G-03` | `E-01` → 🔬 SPIKE-01 | Fan-out — 🔍 Search & Listing · ✏️ Mutations · ⚙️ Complex Operations · 🔗 Federation & Stitching · 🧪 Field Resolvers & Tests |
| 3 | 🟡 `G-04` | — | 🧪 Field Resolvers & Tests |

**Critical path:** `B-01` → `E-01` → `G-04` — 3 sequential stories; everything else hangs off this chain in parallel.

## Recommended Story Graph — 2 Backend Engineers

> The order map above assumes unlimited parallelism; this packs the **same dependency graph onto 2 backend engineers** (greedy critical-chain scheduling, nominal day-ranges from complexity — confirm in refinement). Read each column top-to-bottom as one engineer's queue; ⏳ marks a slot that waits on a dependency, 🔬/⛔ are entry gates that slide a slot without reshuffling the lanes.

| Slot | 👤 BE-1 | 👤 BE-2 |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | 🟢 `B-01` (1–2d) | ⏳ after `B-01` → 🟡 `G-01` (2–4d) |
| 2 | 🟠 `E-01` (4–7d) 🔬 | 🟡 `C-01` (2–4d) |
| 3 | 🟡 `D-01` (2–4d) | 🟡 `D-02` (2–4d) *(grouped XS: +`D-03`, `D-05`)* |
| 4 | 🟡 `D-04` (2–4d) | 🟡 `G-02` (2–4d) |
| 5 | 🟡 `G-03` (2–4d) | 🟡 `G-04` (2–4d) |
| 6 | 🟢 `F-01` (1–2d) | — |

**BE-1:** `B-01` → `E-01` → `D-01` → `D-04` → `G-03` → `F-01`<br>**BE-2:** `G-01` → `C-01` → `D-02` → `G-02` → `G-04`

**Elapsed (nominal midpoints):** ~18 working days with 2 engineers vs ~32 days sequential.

## Jira Stories by Phase
