## What Are We Building?

- We are moving the **Impression** domain (the product's printed/embellished artwork "impressions" and their per-partner counts) off the `spark-internal-graphql` gateway into the **`plm-product`** DGS.
- It is the
**smallest and lowest-risk** of the thirteen domains: 2 queries, 1 mutation, and 6 field resolvers across a
66-line resolver — no polymorphism, no orchestration. We recommend migrating it **first** as a team warm-up
that proves the pipeline end-to-end.

- The only mild wrinkle is the counts query: today it returns the impressions **list** and a field resolver aggregates per-partner counts (re-fetching the product).
- We recommend a cleaner typed result as a fast-follow, but the existing contract can be preserved exactly.

**ACL note:** the current code obtains a per-product capability token via ACL; Per the program-level working decision, **the DGS layer carries no ACL plumbing story** — each domain service performs its own access control; scenario ADRs ([`complexStories/*/02-adr-noacl-*.md`](https://github.com/XXX/blob/main/output/complexStories/*/02-adr-noacl-*.md)) record the assumption's impact and ratify with the global decision. ACL is noted in stories for context only.

## Migration Scope

| Surface | Count | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Queries | 2 | one reuses the other's REST call |
| Mutations | 1 | delete + update sets in one PUT |
| Field-resolver type blocks | 2 | `Impression` (5), `ImpressionCount` (1) |
| External dependencies | 4 keys (0 🔴 · 1 🟡 · 3 🔵) | workspace, VMM, user-profile |
| Federation contributions | 1 (Product extension) | BLOCKED-BY product |
| **Total stories** | **7** | green-field |

## Spikes & Complex Cases

> This domain's complex, cross-cutting problems are tracked once as **program spikes** in the global breakdown — see **Phase 0 — Program Spikes** (the table) and **Spike Detail** (the brief, the decision, intended cross-domain steps, and every affected resolver's external deps + current logic) in the "Federated+Graphql+Stories+-+BreakDown" overview. Nothing from there is repeated here; the stories below just **link** to it.

> _No spike-gated stories in this domain._

> Simple, intuitive decisions (drift-op cleanup, dead-method audits, auth-token parity, sort/DTO shape) are resolved inline in the owning story — they are **not** spikes.

## Effort Snapshot

| Phase | Name | Stories | Effort (est., +20%) |
|---|---|---|---|
| B | Core Reads (incl. DGS module init + ImpressionService wiring) | 2 | 4–6d |
| D | Mutations | 1 | 2–3d |
| F | Federation (Product) | 1 | 1–2d (BLOCKED-BY product) |
| G | Field Resolvers & Tests | 3 | 4–7d |
| **Total** | | **7** | **11–18d** (buffered) |


**Capacity Planning**

| Team size | Calendar | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 1 engineer | ~3–5 sprints | sequential |
| 2 engineers | ~2–3 sprints | reads + field resolvers parallel |

---

## Recommended Sprint Sequencing

| Sprint | Stories | Focus |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | B-01 + B-02 | **B-01:** DGS module init (schema/types/stubs/scalars) + ImpressionService wiring + `searchImpressionsByProductId`; **B-02:** counts query |
| 2 | D-01 + G-01 + G-02 | mutation + field resolvers + counts aggregation |
| 3 | G-03 | tests & parity |
| post-launch | F-01 | Product extension (unblocked by product) |

---

## Recommended Implementation Order

> Derived from each story's `Depends On` edges (plus the module-init scaffold as the implicit first step). A story appears in the earliest step where everything it depends on is already done; **stories in the same step are independent of each other and parallelize across engineers**. **Focus** names the phase category each step advances — same convention as the frontend order map.

> 🔬 spike gates and ⛔ cross-subgraph blocks are *entry criteria*, not ordering edges — a gated story slides later without reshuffling the map.

| Step | Stories (parallel set) | Entry gates in this step | Focus |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 🟢 `B-01` | — | 🧱 Module init — schema skeleton, service wiring (unblocks everything) |
| 2 | 🟢 `B-02`, 🟡 `D-01`, 🟢 `F-01`, 🟢 `G-01`, 🟡 `G-02`, 🟢 `G-04` | `F-01` → ⛔ BLOCKED-BY product B-01 | Fan-out — 📖 Core Reads · ✏️ Mutations · 🔗 Federation & Stitching · 🧪 Field Resolvers & Tests |
| 3 | 🟢 `G-03` | — | 🧪 Field Resolvers & Tests |

**Critical path:** `B-01` → `D-01` → `G-03` — 3 sequential stories; everything else hangs off this chain in parallel.

---

## Recommended Story Graph — 2 Backend Engineers

> The order map above assumes unlimited parallelism; this packs the **same dependency graph onto 2 backend engineers** (greedy critical-chain scheduling, nominal day-ranges from complexity — confirm in refinement). Read each column top-to-bottom as one engineer's queue; ⏳ marks a slot that waits on a dependency, 🔬/⛔ are entry gates that slide a slot without reshuffling the lanes.

| Slot | 👤 BE-1 | 👤 BE-2 |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | 🟢 `B-01` (1–2d) | ⏳ after `B-01` → 🟡 `G-02` (2–4d) |
| 2 | 🟡 `D-01` (2–4d) | 🟢 `F-01` (1–2d) ⛔ |
| 3 | 🟢 `B-02` (1–2d) | 🟢 `G-03` (1–2d) |
| 4 | 🟢 `G-01` (1–2d) | — |
| 5 | 🟢 `G-04` (1–2d) | — |

**BE-1:** `B-01` → `D-01` → `B-02` → `G-01` → `G-04`<br>**BE-2:** `G-02` → `F-01` → `G-03`

**Elapsed (nominal midpoints):** ~9 working days with 2 engineers vs ~15 days sequential.

## Jira Stories by Phase

> Each row is one Jira story. Complexity drives T-shirt sizing in refinement. `Depends On` lists blocking story IDs within this domain — including Phase 0 spikes where a story's implementation is gated on a spike's outcome.

### 📖 Phase B — Core Reads (2 stories)

| Story | Complexity | Type | Depends On | Acceptance Criteria |
|---|---|---|---|---|
