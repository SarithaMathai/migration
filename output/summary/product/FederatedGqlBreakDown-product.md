#### What Are We Building?

- We are moving **Product** — the central entity of the PLM system — off the `spark-internal-graphql` gateway into the **`plm-product`** Netflix DGS.
- Product is the **largest and highest-risk** domain (18 queries, 20 mutations, ~50 field resolvers on a 2,629-line resolver) and the **host service** for the whole product family: BOM, Measurement, Impression, Packaging and others live in the same DGS, so their links from Product resolve **internally** rather than across the federation gateway.

- Most of the work is mechanical (the long tail of CRUD and simple field resolvers), but a handful of items carry real risk: the **TechPack count** query (a ~200-line, 14-step aggregation spanning 8 domains' data via 4 physical services, which becomes a federated composite-key entity), the **partner drop/undrop** orchestration, the cross-domain **components** and **attachmentsWithMetaData** field resolvers, and a **latent `division` bug**.
- We recommend the **facade-then-federate** approach for TechPack (draft **ADR-015** Option B; the pattern `techpack-migration-options.md` labels "Option D (hybrid)"): ship a thin query over a temporary aggregation facade so it works on day 1, then federate each piece to its owning domain, then retire the facade (`F-09`).

**ACL note:** the legacy gateway obtains per-resource capability tokens via ACL on nearly every call. Per
**ADR-019** ([`complexStories/acl/01-adr-acl-mid-request-update.md`](https://github.com/XXX/blob/main/output/complexStories/acl/01-adr-acl-mid-request-update.md)), permission-check and own-domain-token
call sites stay resolver-local (context-only, unchanged); downstream-token call sites — where a resolver
hands its token to a *different* domain's loader — use **Mid-Request ACL Update**
(`SparkSecurityService.updateCurrentUserPermissions(capabilityToken)`) before the downstream call.

#### Migration Scope

| Surface | Count | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Queries | 18 | incl. TechPack (Very High) and two-stage `getProducts` |
| Mutations | 20 (+3 deferred) | incl. partner actions + component fan-out |
| Field-resolver stories | ~16 | incl. 2 X-Large (attachmentsWithMetaData, components) |
| External dependencies | 12 EXT + 6 platform | search/attachment/workspace 🔴 |
| Composite-key aggregate | 1 (TechPack `ResourcesCount`) | 8 sibling subgraphs extend it |
| Federation contributions received | 8 | from sibling domains (Phase F placeholders) |
| **Total stories** | **67** | green-field build stories (`G-11` split into `G-11-1`/`G-11-2` = +1). The 3 Phase-0 spike stubs (`S-01`–`S-03`) are tracked as **program spikes** in the global breakdown and Jira, not as rows here |

---

#### Spikes & Complex Cases

> This domain's complex, cross-cutting problems are tracked once as **program spikes** in the global breakdown — see **Phase 0 — Program Spikes** (the table) and **Spike Detail** (the brief, the decision, intended cross-domain steps, and every affected resolver's external deps + current logic) in the "Federated+Graphql+Stories+-+BreakDown" overview. Nothing from there is repeated here; the stories below just **link** to it.

**Spike-gated stories in this domain** — each is flagged 🔴🔬 in its phase table with the same id in `Depends On`. *(Engineer: follow the id to the global **Spike Detail** for the target flow + the external services each resolver calls. See **How to read the spikes & related stories** in the global doc.)*

| Story | Program spike | Bucket |
|---|---|---|
| 🔴🔬 `PRODUCT-BE-C-01` — `getProducts(...)` two-stage hydration | `SPIKE-06a` | Hydration |
| 🔴🔬 `PRODUCT-BE-D-01` — `addProduct` | `SPIKE-06b` | Cross-Domain Association |
| 🔴🔬 `PRODUCT-BE-D-02` — `addProducts` (bulk) | `SPIKE-06b` | Cross-Domain Association |
| 🔴🔬 `PRODUCT-BE-D-04` — `updateProduct` | `SPIKE-06b` | Cross-Domain Association |
| 🔴🔬 `PRODUCT-BE-E-00` — `WriteSaga` shared module (Sprint 0, critical path) | `SPIKE-01` | Non-Atomic Write Saga |
| 🔴🔬 `PRODUCT-BE-E-01` — `productBusinessPartnerActions` (REMOVE/DROP/UNDROP) | `SPIKE-03` | Partner Drop/Undrop + Ownership |
| 🔴🔬 `PRODUCT-BE-E-02` — `updateComponentStatuses` (5-loader fan-out) | `SPIKE-01` | Non-Atomic Write Saga |
| 🔴🔬 `PRODUCT-BE-E-03` — `getProductTechPackCountV1` stub + aggregation facade (facade-then-federate, Phase 1) | `SPIKE-02` | TechPack Aggregate |
| 🔴🔬 `PRODUCT-BE-E-04` — `getProductTechPackBulkCountV1` (bulk wrapper, ordering fix) | `SPIKE-02` | TechPack Aggregate |
| 🔴🔬 `PRODUCT-BE-G-07` — `Product.vendorAttributes` + `businessPartners` + `droppedPartners` + `unDroppablePartners` + `status` | `SPIKE-04` | Not-Removable / Undroppable Partners |
| 🔴🔬 `PRODUCT-BE-G-11-1` — `Product.notRemovablePartnerIds` + `notRemovableWorkspaceIds` | `SPIKE-04` | Not-Removable / Undroppable Partners |

> Follow a story's `SPIKE-0x` id to the global **Spike Detail** for its brief, steps and cross-service resolver breakdown.

> Simple, intuitive decisions (drift-op cleanup, dead-method audits, auth-token parity, sort/DTO shape) are resolved inline in the owning story — they are **not** spikes.

#### Deployment Model — Ship on Green, Per Story

- Every story is **end-to-end in one PR** and **independently deployable to production once its own tests and parity pass** — no waiting for the rest of the phase.
- The **one exception** is a story whose field is produced by **composing another subgraph's data** (a cross-subgraph **entity extension**, `extend type … @key` resolved by a different DGS): those go live only once the **owning subgraph is deployed**, and are marked
**BLOCKED-BY `<domain>`**.

- ✅ **Ships on green** — all B/C/D/E/G stories, the internal Phase-F contributions (`F-04`, `F-06`, `F-08`), the
  gateway/platform stories (`F-10`, `F-11`), and the **TechPack facade** (`E-03`/`E-04`), which is *designed* to
  work day 1 before any sibling federates.
- ⛔ **Waits for an owning subgraph (the exception)** — the true cross-subgraph federation stories
  **`H-01` (attachment), `H-02` (discussion), `H-03` (sample), `H-04` (claim), `H-05` (construction)**, plus
  **`F-09`** (facade retirement, which needs all 8 contributions live). These are the only stories held back
  from per-story prod release.

#### Effort Snapshot

| Phase | Name | Stories | Effort (est., +20% buffer) |
|-------|------|---------|----------------------------|
| B | Core Reads | 11 | 13–26d |
| C | Search & Listing | 5 | 14–28d |
| D | Mutations | 18 | 28–55d |
| E | Complex Operations | 5 | 35–60d |
| F | Federation & Stitching | 8 | 10–19d |
| G | Field Resolvers & Tests | 16 | 52–97d |
| H | Entity Resolution | 6 | 14–29d |
| **Total** | | **69** | **166–314d** (buffered) |

> Computed live from `be-04-stories.md` (phase + complexity per story) — always reconciles with the story tables below and the program overview. Effort = sum of per-story nominal day-ranges (Low 1–2 · Medium 2–4 · High 4–7 · Very High 7–12) × 1.2 buffer, AI-estimated — confirm in refinement. See each story's **Depends On** column for real sequencing.


**Capacity Planning**

| Team size | Calendar | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 1 engineer | ~39–66 sprints | sequential — not recommended for this domain |
| 2 engineers | ~25–42 sprints | B/C/D parallel after B-01 |
| 3–4 engineers | ~18–28 sprints | A done → B + C + D + most of G in parallel; E and the two X-Large fields on dedicated owners |

> Phase G dominates the calendar; the two X-Large field resolvers (`attachmentsWithMetaData`, `components`)
> and TechPack (E-03/E-04) are the cost-and-risk centre of the whole program.

#### Recommended Sprint Sequencing

| Sprint | Stories | Focus |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | Program spikes | run in Sprint 0 (see global Phase 0 — Program Spikes) so D/C/E work isn't waiting |
| 1–2 | B-01 (DGS module init + service wiring + first resolver) | schema, types, stubs, Categories resolver, ResourcesCount, service port |
| 3 | B-01–B-11 | all core reads (incl. rules reads) |
| 4 | C-01–C-05 | search/listing + rating + rules search (C-01 needs `SPIKE-06a` concluded) |
| 5–6 | D-01–D-18 | all simple mutations, parallelizable (D-01/D-02/D-04 need `SPIKE-06b` concluded; D-03/D-06/D-07/D-11 unblocked) |
| 7–8 | E-03/E-04 | TechPack facade + bulk (focused; facade-then-federate direction already resolved, draft ADR-015) |
| 9 | E-00 (shared `WriteSaga` module, Sprint-0 critical path) + E-01/E-02 | partner actions (needs `SPIKE-03` concluded) + component fan-out |
| 10–12 | G-01–G-10, G-11-1, G-11-2, G-13–G-14 | field resolvers (G-01/G-02 X-Large get their own sprint) |
| 13 | G-15 | utils port (Kotlin). Test coverage/parity/load/cut-over rehearsal tracked outside this Jira pipeline, created manually. |
| post-launch | H-01–H-06, F-09 | TechPack federation (unblocked as siblings migrate) + facade retirement |
| any | F-10–F-12 | gateway composition + platform verify + drift decision |

#### Recommended Implementation Order

> Derived from each story's `Depends On` edges (plus the module-init scaffold as the implicit first step). A story appears in the earliest step where everything it depends on is already done; **stories in the same step are independent of each other and parallelize across engineers**. **Focus** names the phase category each step advances — same convention as the frontend order map.

> 🔬 spike gates and ⛔ cross-subgraph blocks are *entry criteria*, not ordering edges — a gated story slides later without reshuffling the map.

#### Jira Stories by Phase

> Each row is one Jira story. Complexity drives T-shirt sizing in refinement. `Depends On` lists blocking story IDs within this domain — including Phase 0 spikes where a story's implementation is gated on a spike's outcome.

> **`PRODUCT-BE-B-01`** — **Note — DGS Module Init (this PR only):** Creates `product.graphqls` (federation v2.3 header, scalars, owned types with `@key`, external stubs), registers scalars in `ScalarConfig.kt`, and wires the service and Feign client. Full type list: be-03-schema.graphql. **This scaffold is a prerequisite for every B/C/D/G story** — they need the module + schema file to compile their DGS wrapper — so it is assumed globally (shown once in the dependency graph) and **not repeated** in each story's `Depends On`. After it lands, the wrappers parallelize.

#### What Are We Changing?

- Point the **Product** GraphQL operations in `pdex-ui-react` at the federated router (subgraph `plm-product (host)`) behind the platform feature flag, then remove legacy-gateway assumptions (typenames, cache keys, fragments).
- Cutover is per-domain and reversible: dual-run first, flag flip after parity, legacy path kept until the exit criterion holds.

#### Recommended Implementation Order

> Staged from each story's dependencies: the backend phase its BE stories sit in (reads → search → writes → sagas) plus in-domain FE→FE chains. **Stories in the same step are independent of each other and parallelize.** ADR ratifications are entry gates, not ordering edges.

| Step | Stories (parallel set) | Waits for | Focus |
|---|---|---|---|
| 3 | 🟡 `PRODUCT-FE-007` | `PRODUCT-FE-007` → `PRODUCT-BE-D-01`, `PRODUCT-BE-D-02`, `PRODUCT-BE-D-03`, `PRODUCT-BE-D-04` (+4) | Writes — needs backend phase D mutations |
| 4 | 🟡 `PRODUCT-FE-006`, 🟡 `PRODUCT-FE-010`, 🟡 `PRODUCT-FE-012` | `PRODUCT-FE-006` → `PRODUCT-BE-B-07`, `PRODUCT-BE-B-08`, `PRODUCT-BE-B-09`, `PRODUCT-BE-B-10` (+8)<br>`PRODUCT-FE-010` → `PRODUCT-BE-E-03`, `PRODUCT-BE-E-04`, `PRODUCT-BE-F-06`, `PRODUCT-BE-F-08` (+6)<br>`PRODUCT-FE-012` → `PRODUCT-BE-F-14` | Complex writes / sagas — needs backend phase E + ADR ratification |

| 6 | 🟡 `PRODUCT-FE-002`, 🟡 `PRODUCT-FE-008` | `PRODUCT-FE-002` → `PRODUCT-BE-B-01`, `PRODUCT-BE-B-04`, `PRODUCT-BE-F-10`, `PRODUCT-BE-G-01` (+10)<br>`PRODUCT-FE-008` → `PRODUCT-BE-D-06`, `PRODUCT-BE-D-07`, `PRODUCT-BE-D-12` | Follow-on cutover — after the stories it depends on |

**Cutover flow:** `PRODUCT-FE-007` → `PRODUCT-FE-006` → `PRODUCT-FE-010` → `PRODUCT-FE-012` → `PRODUCT-FE-001` → `PRODUCT-FE-003` → `PRODUCT-FE-004` → `PRODUCT-FE-005` → `PRODUCT-FE-009` → `PRODUCT-FE-011` → `PRODUCT-FE-002` → `PRODUCT-FE-008`.

#### Recommended Story Graph — 1 Frontend Engineer

> The staged order map above, run by **one frontend engineer**. Steps re-sync at each stage because the stage's **backend gate** — not engineer availability — is the limiter.

| Step | 👤 FE-1 | Backend gate (focus) |
|---|---|---|
| 3 | 🟡 `PRODUCT-FE-007` (6–10d) | Writes — needs backend phase D mutations |
| 4 | 🟡 `PRODUCT-FE-006` (4–6d)<br>🟡 `PRODUCT-FE-010` (4–6d)<br>🟡 `PRODUCT-FE-012` (3–5d) | Complex writes / sagas — needs backend phase E + ADR ratification |
| 5 | 🔴 `PRODUCT-FE-001` (10–15d)<br>🔴 `PRODUCT-FE-003` (8–12d)<br>🔴 `PRODUCT-FE-009` (8–12d)<br>🟡 `PRODUCT-FE-004` (5–8d)<br>🟡 `PRODUCT-FE-005` (5–8d)<br>🟡 `PRODUCT-FE-011` (4–6d) | Externally gated — search/read-hub decision |
| 6 | 🟡 `PRODUCT-FE-002` (5–8d)<br>🟡 `PRODUCT-FE-008` (4–6d) | Follow-on cutover — after the stories it depends on |

**Elapsed (nominal midpoints):** ~84 FE build days — calendar time is set by the backend gates, not FE capacity.
