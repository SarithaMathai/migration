## Overview

We are migrating the entire Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) GraphQL API surface off the monolithic `spark-internal-graphql` Node.js gateway onto a set of independently owned **Netflix DGS** (Domain Graph Service) subgraphs, federated via the **Hive Schema Registry**.

Each DGS is a Kotlin/Spring Boot service that exposes its domain's schema as a federated subgraph. The supergraph stitches them together transparently for clients.

**Why?**

- The monolith is a ~15,000-line Node.js resolver with no clear ownership boundaries
- Federation gives each team autonomous schema ownership, independent deployability, and fine-grained caching
- Netflix DGS provides production-proven tooling (DataLoaders, code generation, Hive integration)
- Hive Schema Registry enforces schema contracts and enables safe rollout with schema checks

**Engineering model:** every story is self-contained in one PR — schema additions, DGS data fetcher, Kotlin REST service method, and Hive registry push. There are no separate service-layer stories.

**ACL note:** the current gateway obtains per-resource ACL capability tokens. Per the program-level working decision, ACL is **not** re-implemented in the DGS layer — each domain service performs its own access control. Each complex case carries a scenario ADR ([`complexStories/*/02-adr-noacl-*.md`](https://github.com/XXX/blob/main/output/complexStories/*/02-adr-noacl-*.md)) recording this assumption's impact; those ratify together with the global decision. ACL is noted in stories for context only.

## Glossary

| Term | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **DGS** | Netflix Domain Graph Service — a Spring/Kotlin GraphQL subgraph |
| **Hive Gateway / plm-gateway** | the federation gateway that composes the subgraphs into one supergraph |
| **subgraph** | one DGS (e.g. `plm-product`, `plm-sample`) |
| **co-located** | a domain compiling into `plm-product` (in-process call, not a gateway hop) |
| **CAT-1…5** | story categories: 1 schema · 2 resolver · 3 service · 4 federation · 5 tests |

## The migration phases (A→G) — the order of replacement

Stories are grouped into phases that encode the replacement order within a domain:

| Phase | Replaces / builds | Category |
|---|---|---|
| **A** | schema skeleton, owned types, external stubs, `@DgsTypeResolver`, service port, ACL/JWT plumbing | CAT-1/CAT-3 |
| **B / C** | query resolvers (reads) | CAT-2 |
| **D** | mutation resolvers (writes) | CAT-2 |
| **E** | complex operations (multi-step writes, aggregations) — often a stub + facade pointing at a complex case | CAT-2 |
| **F** | federation boundaries — one story per cross-domain edge (`@extends @external`) | CAT-4 |
| **G** | field resolvers (incl. the heavy ones) + the domain parity harness | CAT-2/CAT-5 |

> **Phase 0 = Spikes** — time-boxed research producing a recorded decision before the phase it blocks.

## How to read the spikes & related stories

> The `SPIKE-0x` id is the join key between a **program spike** (here) and the **domain stories** it gates. Read **global → domain** to plan decisions, or **domain → global** to implement.

**👔 Product Owner:**

1. **Phase 0 — Program Spikes table** — what each spike blocks and its status. Nothing dependent starts until the spike's decision is recorded.
2. **Spike Detail** (per bucket) — the brief, the **Decision to make**, the **intended steps**, and the resolver table (blast radius).
3. **Sequencing** — `SPIKE-01/02/03` are critical path (Sprint 0); `04/05/06a/06b` run in parallel. Assign an owner + timebox each.
4. In a **domain page**, the *Spikes & Complex Cases* map lists which of that domain's stories are 🔴🔬-blocked — plan the domain around them.

**🔧 Engineer:**

1. In the **domain A–G table**, find your story. If it's **🔴🔬 with `SPIKE-0x` in Depends On**, the complex part is blocked until that spike concludes — check its status first.
2. **Follow the `SPIKE-0x` id → Spike Detail**: the **intended cross-domain steps** (your target flow) + the resolver table (external services you'll call + what each resolver does today = your parity target).
3. **Research so far** — the **Phase 0 — Program Spikes** table links each spike to its `complexStories/<case>/` brief.
4. **Non-gated stories** (no 🔴🔬) — build straight from the story's Acceptance Criteria; no spike needed.
5. **In Jira/CSV** — the spike is a `Spike` issue (`SPIKE-0x`) with the brief + steps in its description; your gated story lists it in **Depends On**.

> **One-line model —** *Product Owner:* "which decisions block work, who owns them, when?" → the spike table. *Engineer:* "is my story blocked, and once unblocked what's the flow + who do I call?" → follow the id to Spike Detail.

## 🔬 Phase 0 — Program Spikes (cross-domain research buckets)

> **Why this table lives here and not in the domain pages.** The same handful of hard problems recur across many domains under different operation names (e.g. every domain's multi-step `update*` write hits the *same* "no rollback" question). Rather than repeat a decision list on every domain page, each recurring problem is **generalized into one program spike bucket** below. A spike is **time-boxed research that produces a recorded decision** — not shipped code — and every domain story gated on one is marked **🔴🔬 in its domain page** with the spike id in `Depends On`.

> 🔬 **A spike is only for a genuinely complex problem that needs a solve/migrate approach.** Simple, intuitive, one-off decisions (delete-vs-`@deprecate` drift ops, dead service-method audits, auth-token parity, sort pushdown, DTO request-shape) are **not** spikes — they are resolved inline in the owning story's acceptance criteria and no longer appear anywhere as a decision table.

| Spike ID | Bucket / Generic Problem | Domains affected (home story) | Blocks | Research so far | Status |

| `SPIKE-06b` | 🔬 **Cross-Domain Association** — one pattern for a mutation that also *links* its record into a sibling domain (workspace/attachment), incl. sync-vs-async and partial-failure handling. `D-03` is a pure passthrough (no cross-domain call); `D-06`/`D-07`/`D-11` are single-backend writes — the product backend owns all endpoints, no sibling service called (draft ADR-011 §1). | product `S-01` (gates `D-01`/`D-02`/`D-04` only — see scope note) | association-side writes (D-01/D-02/D-04) | [`complexStories/cross-domain-association`](https://github.com/XXX/tree/main/output/complexStories/cross-domain-association) (brief + draft ADR-011) | 🟠 Draft ADR-011 proposed (sync orchestration + shared association component) — ratification pending |

> **Sequencing:** `SPIKE-01/02/03` are on the critical path (they block `E`-phase writes and TechPack); run them in Sprint 0 alongside each domain's `B-01` module scaffold. `04/05/06a/06b` block specific reads/writes and can run in parallel. Each spike concludes with the decision recorded back into the affected domain stories.
>
> **Note on `06a`/`06b`:** these were originally tracked as one `SPIKE-06` id. They're split because they answer different questions — 06a is "how do I *read* another domain's data," 06b is "how does my *write* also link into another domain" — and a story should only cite the one it actually needs.

### Non-spike complex cases (read pattern applied at cutover — no research decision needed)

> These recur across domains too, but the shape of the fix is already known (per-domain contribution + fan-out merge) — there's nothing to research, just build. They still get one `complexStories/` brief each so the pattern is documented once instead of per-domain.

| Bucket | Generic Problem | Domains affected (home story) | Research so far |

## 🔬 Spike Detail — the brief + the resolvers each spike touches

> For each spike: what it means, the decision to make, and the exact queries/mutations/field-resolvers it covers — with the **external services each one calls today** and a **one-line summary of its current logic**, so an engineer knows what to look at before starting.

### 🔬 `SPIKE-01` · Non-Atomic Write Saga

- Some “save” buttons actually fire two or three separate backend calls in a row (e.g. first update which workspaces a record belongs to, then save the record body, then save its permissions).
- There is no database transaction across them, so if call 2 or 3 fails, call 1 is already committed and nothing undoes it — the record is left half-saved.
- This spike picks one consistent way to detect and recover from that partial failure for every write of this shape.

**Decision to make:** Pick (a) compensating saga, (b) compensation-log + best-effort, or (c) best-effort — and write down how to undo each step.

**Intended cross-domain steps:**

1. Open a **write-saga** and record each step so it can be undone
2. PUT **workspace-association** first (compensatable — remembers add/remove to reverse)
3. PUT the **record body** (typed validation exception on error)
4. PUT **permissions/partners** only if the input carries them
5. On any step failure → run the chosen strategy: compensate (saga) or log + best-effort

| Resolver (home story) | Domain | Kind | Calls (external services) | What it does today (minimal) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 🔴🔬 `BOM-BE-E-01` `updateBom` — 3-step orchestrated write | bom | Mutation | `workspaceV2` | editing a bom today is really three separate backend calls made one - after another, with no undo button: (1) if the caller changed which workspaces the bom belongs… |

### 🔬 `SPIKE-02` · TechPack Aggregate

- A “TechPack” is one screen that shows counts and lists pulled from ~8 different backend services (attachments, discussions, samples, claims, BOMs, measurements, constructions, watchlists).
- Today a single gateway helper calls all of them and adds up the numbers.
- This spike decides how to assemble that one entity under federation so each service owns and contributes its own slice.

**Decision to make:** Ratify the assembly pattern and each domain’s contribution. Draft ADR-015 proposes **facade-then-federate** (ADR-015 Option B; the catalogue label is "Option D (hybrid)"): a frozen aggregation facade serves all 11 fields day 1 (`E-03`/`E-04`); each domain re-homes its slice as its subgraph ships (`F-01`–`F-08`, `extend type ResourcesCount`); the facade retires last (`F-09`).

**Intended cross-domain steps:**

1. **Phase 1 (`E-03`/`E-04`)** — thin `@DgsQuery` stub in `plm-product` → frozen aggregation facade answers all 11 `ResourcesCount` fields (works day 1, before any sibling federates)
2. **Phase 2 (`F-01`–`F-08`)** — as each owning subgraph ships, it contributes its slice via `extend type ResourcesCount @key(fields: "productId partnerId")`; the facade stops serving that field (per-slice parity fixture gates the flip)
3. Each subgraph returns **only its own slice** (its count/list) — it owns that field; co-located domains (bom/measurement/construction/watchlist) contribute in-process
4. **Phase 3 (`F-09`)** — facade retired; the gateway resolves the `@key` shell and fans out `_entities` to the contributors

| Resolver (home story) | Domain | Kind | Calls (external services) | What it does today (minimal) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 🔴🔬 `PRODUCT-BE-E-03` `getProductTechPackCountV1` stub + aggregation facade (facade-then-federate, Phase 1) | product | Query | `attachment`, `search` | the TechPack panel shows badge counts (attachments, discussions, - samples, boms, claims, etc.) for a product. - Getting those counts today means walking the entire… |

### 🔬 `SPIKE-03` · Partner Drop/Undrop + Ownership

- When a business partner is dropped or undropped from a product or workspace, every child domain that references that partner has to be updated too.
- This spike decides who orchestrates that fan-out write and how it recovers if one of the child updates fails midway.

**Decision to make:** Decide ownership (domain subgraph vs workspace) and the write-saga/rollback for the drop/undrop fan-out.

**Intended cross-domain steps:**

1. Owner (product/workspace) receives the **drop/undrop** request and starts the orchestration
2. **Fans out** the write to every child domain that references the partner
3. Each child applies its change with **per-target failure isolation** (one failure is visible, doesn't swallow the rest)
4. On partial failure → compensate/log per the SPIKE-01 saga

| Resolver (home story) | Domain | Kind | Calls (external services) | What it does today (minimal) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 🔴🔬 `PRODUCT-BE-E-01` `productBusinessPartnerActions` (REMOVE/DROP/UNDROP) | product | Mutation | `sampleV2`, `recentlyViewed`, `todo`, `favorite` | removing, dropping, or un-dropping a business partner from a product - isn't one write — it's a ~220-line dispatcher that updates the partner's status and then fans… |


---

### 🔬 `SPIKE-04` · Not-Removable / Undroppable Partners

- The UI needs to know which partners can’t be removed yet because something still references them.
- Answering that means asking several domains “do you still use this partner?” and combining the answers.
- This spike designs that cross-domain read.

**Decision to make:** Agree the `@requires` contribution each domain exposes and where the union is computed.

**Intended cross-domain steps:**

1. Owner exposes the public field (`notRemovablePartnerIds` / `unDroppablePartners`)
2. Each contributing domain declares its refs as **`@external`**; owner **`@requires`** them
3. Gateway fetches every domain's contribution and **batches** them
4. Owner resolver **unions + dedupes** into the final answer

| Resolver (home story) | Domain | Kind | Calls (external services) | What it does today (minimal) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 🔴🔬 `PRODUCT-BE-G-07` `Product.vendorAttributes` + `businessPartners` + `droppedPartners` + `unDroppablePartners` + `status` | product | Field resolver | `vmm` | business-partner ids sometimes arrive as strings that need to be - parsed to ints before VMM will accept them (vmmUtils's int-parse normalization) — an easy detail to… |

---

### 🔬 `SPIKE-05` · Polymorphic Type Resolution

- Some GraphQL types are interfaces or unions — one field can return one of several concrete shapes, chosen by a category code.
- This spike confirms the full code→type mapping and how the resolver dispatches each row to the right variant.

**Decision to make:** Confirm the `code → type` table + union membership, then wire `@DgsTypeResolver` + CI conformance.

**Intended cross-domain steps:**

1. Read the row's **category code** (or union discriminator)
2. `@DgsTypeResolver` maps code → **concrete type** (unknown → base type)
3. Resolve the **per-variant** field set for that concrete type
4. CI **schema-conformance** check fails the build if a variant misses an interface field

| Resolver (home story) | Domain | Kind | Calls (external services) | What it does today (minimal) |

### 🔬 `SPIKE-06a` · Hydration

- One domain often needs to **read** another domain’s object (e.g. a `product` on a `bom`).
- This spike decides whether to stitch it as a federated `@key` reference or call the other service directly, plus the order the services must ship so nothing launches half-wired.

**Decision to make:** Choose federated `@key` reference vs REST client per edge, and the cross-DGS rollout order.

**Intended cross-domain steps:**

1. Decide the edge shape: **federated `@key` reference** vs a direct **REST client** call
2. If `@key`: emit the key and let the **owning subgraph** hydrate it (gateway hop)
3. If REST: call the other service **in-process/directly** and map the result
4. Sequence the **rollout order** so no consumer launches before its provider is federated

| Resolver (home story) | Domain | Kind | Calls (external services) | What it does today (minimal) |
|---|---|---|---|---|

### 🔬 `SPIKE-06b` · Cross-Domain Association

- A mutation on one domain’s record often also has to **link** that record into a sibling domain — attach files, put it in a workspace, add teams, add partners.
- This spike decides the one pattern every such mutation should follow (sync direct call / event-driven / shared `AssociationService`), instead of each mutation inventing its own “write, then also link” logic.
- Unlike `06a`, there is no read-hydration or federated-reference question here — this is purely about how a *write* fans out to a sibling domain. **Scope (per draft ADR-011 §1):** `D-03` (`bulkUpdateProducts`) is a pure passthrough — no cross-domain call.
- `D-06`/`D-07`/`D-11` ("Collab Canvas") are cross-domain in concept but all their endpoints are on the product backend; no external workspace/partner service is called.
- Only **D-01, D-02, D-04** are in scope.

**Decision to make:** Pick the association pattern (see `PRODUCT-BE-S-01`'s three candidates) and how a mid-flight association failure is handled.

**Intended cross-domain steps:**

1. Primary mutation writes its own record (product create/update)
2. If the input carries a cross-domain link (`workspaceId`, `copyProduct`, template attachments) → build the association per the **chosen S-01 pattern** (draft ADR-011: shared association component, sync, service-to-service REST)
3. Apply the link to the target domain (workspace, attachment)
4. Record what happens if the link step fails after the primary write succeeded (today: mostly silent/undocumented; per-mutation failure policy is declared explicitly under ADR-011)

| Resolver (home story) | Domain | Kind | Calls (external services) | What it does today (minimal) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 🔴🔬 `PRODUCT-BE-D-01` `addProduct` | product | Mutation | `workspaceV2`, `attachment` | POST ${v1} + optional copyProductToProduct(copyProduct) + workspace association |
| 🔴🔬 `PRODUCT-BE-D-02` `addProducts` (bulk) | product | Mutation | `attachment` | bulk POST ${v1}/bulk + attachment-link side-effects (no rollback — preserve, flag) |
| 🔴🔬 `PRODUCT-BE-D-04` `updateProduct` | product | Mutation | `attachment` | PUT ${v1}/{id} + optional copy + archive removed-template attachments (template branch) |
