## What Are We Building?

- We are moving the **Bill of Materials (BOM)** domain off the shared Node.js `spark-internal-graphql` gateway and into the **`plm-product`** Netflix DGS service, where it lives next to Product, Measurement, Impression and Packaging.
- BOM is the structured record of every material, supplier and impression that makes up a product, and it is referenced by many sibling domains.

- BOM is **mid-sized**: 13 queries, 6 mutations, and ~46 field resolvers across 18 type blocks, on a 735-line resolver.
- Its defining challenge is **material polymorphism** — 7 concrete material types (Trim, Wash, Fabric, FabricSpec, Combination, Packaging, plus the base) resolved by a category dispatcher, and 5 impression sub-types.
- The single hardest piece of work is `updateBom`, a 3-step write (workspace → body → permissions) that today has no rollback.

- The schema is **wide but shallow**: the large majority of attributes are direct pass-throughs (cheap to migrate).
- Risk concentrates in ~38 cross-domain field resolvers (material-library and color lookups) and the 2 polymorphic interfaces.
- See be-05-attribute-inventory.md.

**Note on ACL:** the current gateway uses ACL to obtain a per-resource capability token. Per decision,
Per the program-level working decision, **the DGS layer carries no ACL plumbing story** — each domain service performs its own access control; scenario ADRs ([`complexStories/*/02-adr-noacl-*.md`](https://github.com/XXX/blob/main/output/complexStories/*/02-adr-noacl-*.md)) record the assumption's impact and ratify with the global decision. ACL is noted in stories for context only.

## Migration Scope

| Surface | Count | Notes |
|---------|-------|-------|
| Queries | 12 | 4 are cacheable master-data lookups. `getBomDataV2` removed (`Bom_Unified` deprecated) |
| Mutations | 6 | 5 simple + `updateBom` (complex) |
| Field-resolver type blocks | 17 | one story each. `BomMaterial_Unified` removed; impression branch (`G-10`) rescoped, not removed |
| Material polymorphism | 7 types + interface + type resolver | B-01 |
| Impression polymorphism | 5 types + interface | B-01 |
| External dependencies | 12 loader keys (2 🔴 · 6 🟡 · 4 🔵) | sibling DGS + VMM platform |
| Federation contributions | 2 (Product extension, ResourcesCount.bomsCount) | BLOCKED-BY product |
| **Total stories** | **36** | green-field build stories. The 3 Phase-0 spike stubs are tracked as **program spikes** in the global breakdown and Jira, not as rows here (see global Phase 0) |

## Spikes & Complex Cases

> This domain's complex, cross-cutting problems are tracked once as **program spikes** in the global breakdown — see **Phase 0 — Program Spikes** (the table) and **Spike Detail** (the brief, the decision, intended cross-domain steps, and every affected resolver's external deps + current logic) in the "Federated+Graphql+Stories+-+BreakDown" overview. Nothing from there is repeated here; the stories below just **link** to it.

**Spike-gated stories in this domain** — each is flagged 🔴🔬 in its phase table with the same id in `Depends On`. *(Engineer: follow the id to the global **Spike Detail** for the target flow + the external services each resolver calls. See **How to read the spikes & related stories** in the global doc.)*

| Story | Program spike | Bucket |
|---|---|---|
| 🔴🔬 `BOM-BE-A-04` — `@DgsTypeResolver` for the 2 BOM interfaces | `SPIKE-05` | Polymorphic Type Resolution |
| 🔴🔬 `BOM-BE-B-05` — `getBomMaterialTypes` (merge with Material Hub) | `SPIKE-06a` | Hydration |
| 🔴🔬 `BOM-BE-E-01` — `updateBom` — 3-step orchestrated write | `SPIKE-01` | Non-Atomic Write Saga |

> Follow a story's `SPIKE-0x` id to the global **Spike Detail** for its brief, steps and cross-service resolver breakdown.

> Simple, intuitive decisions (drift-op cleanup, dead-method audits, auth-token parity, sort/DTO shape) are resolved inline in the owning story — they are **not** spikes.

---

## Deployment Model — Ship on Green, Per Story

Each story is **end-to-end in one PR** (schema + DGS data fetcher + Kotlin service method + Hive push) and is
**independently deployable to production the moment its own tests and parity pass** — you don't wait for the
rest of the phase to finish.

- The **one exception** is a story whose field is produced by **composing another subgraph's data** — a cross-subgraph **entity extension** (`extend type … @key`, resolved by a *different* DGS).
- Those can only go live once the **owning subgraph is deployed**, so they are held and marked **BLOCKED-BY `<domain>`**.

- ✅ **Ships on green** — every BOM story here, including `F-01`/`F-02`. Those two contribute fields to
  `Product`/`ResourcesCount`, but **within the same `plm-product` subgraph** (internal `@DgsData`, not
  cross-subgraph federation), so they are *not* gated on a separate deployment — they ship as soon as the
  Product types exist in the shared schema.
- ⛔ **Waits for an owning subgraph** — **none in BOM.** BOM consumes sibling material subgraphs
  (hub/trim/wash/fabric/combination) for *enrichment*, but a material field simply returns `{id}` until its
  sibling is federated (rolled out per program spike `SPIKE-06a`), so the story still ships; it just shows partial enrichment until then.

## Effort Snapshot

| Phase | Name | Stories | Effort (est., +20% buffer) | Ready when |
|-------|------|---------|----------------------------|-----------|
| A | BOM material `@DgsTypeResolver` (1) | 1 | 2–3d |
| B | Core Reads | 7 | 7–12d | after B-01. (`B-02` removed) |
| C | Search & Listing | 5 | 9–15d | after B-01 |
| D | Mutations (simple) | 5 | 5–10d | after B-01 |
| E | Complex (`updateBom`) | 1 | 6–10d | after B-01, D-02 · gated on `SPIKE-01` |
| F | Federation Contributions | 2 | 4–7d | BLOCKED-BY product |
| G | Field Resolvers & Tests | 15 | 32–52d | after B-01. (`G-02` removed, `G-10` rescoped) |
| **Total** | | **36** | **68–113d** (buffered) | |

> One engineer ≈ **14–23 sprints** (5d). Phases B/C/D/G parallelize heavily after B-01.

> **Phase A is one story** — `BOM-BE-A-04`, the material/impression `@DgsTypeResolver`. All *other* former Phase-A scaffolding (schema skeleton, service wiring, external stubs) is folded into the **B-01** checklist, done in the same PR.

> **Self-contained story model.** The DGS-on-REST framework already exists; every operation story is **end-to-end in one PR** — schema (query/mutation + the GraphQL types it returns) + DGS data fetcher + Kotlin REST service method (read/write) + push the schema change to **Hive**. The standalone `*Service` Kotlin-port story has been dissolved into the operation stories; the BOM material `@DgsTypeResolver` remains a dedicated story.

> **Thin DGS wrappers — parallel after B-01.** The model, REST controller (GET/POST/PUT) and service already exist; each story only adds the Netflix-DGS layer so the federated graph can stitch this subgraph. The **one-time DGS module scaffold** B-01 lands (schema file + scalar registration + service/Feign wiring) is a prerequisite for every operation story, so it is **assumed — not repeated in each story's `Depends On`** (rows list only genuine story-to-story dependencies). After B-01, phases B/C/D/G run fully in parallel.


**Capacity Planning**

| Team size | Calendar (5d sprints) | Notes |
|-----------|----------------------|-------|
| 1 engineer | ~15–25 sprints | sequential |
| 2 engineers | ~9–15 sprints | B/C/D + most of G parallel |
| 3 engineers | ~6–10 sprints | critical path A → E-01 → G-08/G-10 → G-16 |

> Phase G (field resolvers) dominates the calendar; G-08 (trim) and G-10 (impression branch) are the two
> biggest field-resolver stories.

## Recommended Sprint Sequencing

| Sprint | Stories | Focus |
|--------|---------|-------|
| 0 | Program spikes | run in Sprint 0 (see global Phase 0 — Program Spikes) so E-01/rollout-order aren't waiting |
| 1 | B-01 (DGS module init + service wiring + first resolver) | schema, stubs, type resolvers, service port |
| 2 | B-01, B-03–B-08 + D-03/D-04 | reads (incl. 4 cacheable) + lock/unlock |
| 3 | C-01–C-05 + D-01/D-02/D-05 | search/supplier + simple mutations |
| 4 | E-01 | `updateBom` 3-step write (focused; needs `SPIKE-01` concluded) |
| 5 | G-01, G-03–G-07 | entity + simple material field resolvers |
| 6 | G-08 + G-09 | trim (large) + wash |
| 7 | G-10–G-15 | impression branches + search-result enrichment + trivial bundle |
| 8 | G-16 | tests, parity harness, load test |
| post-launch | F-01, F-02 | federation contributions (unblocked by product) |

## Recommended Implementation Order

> Derived from each story's `Depends On` edges (plus the module-init scaffold as the implicit first step). A story appears in the earliest step where everything it depends on is already done; **stories in the same step are independent of each other and parallelize across engineers**. **Focus** names the phase category each step advances — same convention as the frontend order map.

> 🔬 spike gates and ⛔ cross-subgraph blocks are *entry criteria*, not ordering edges — a gated story slides later without reshuffling the map.

| Step | Stories (parallel set) | Entry gates in this step | Focus |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 🟢 `B-01` | — | 🧱 Module init — schema skeleton, service wiring (unblocks everything) |
| 2 | 🟡 `A-04`, 🟡 `B-03`, 🟡 `B-05`, 🟢 `B-08`, 🟡 `C-01`, 🟡 `C-02`, 🟡 `C-03`, 🟡 `D-01`, 🟡 `D-02`, 🟡 `F-01`, 🟢 `F-02`, 🟡 `G-01`, 🟡 `G-03`, 🟡 `G-04`, 🟠 `G-08`, 🟢 `G-09`, 🟠 `G-10` | `A-04` → 🔬 SPIKE-05<br>`B-05` → 🔬 SPIKE-06a | Fan-out — 🧱 Foundation & Type Resolvers · 📖 Core Reads · 🔍 Search & Listing · ✏️ Mutations · 🔗 Federation & Stitching · 🧪 Field Resolvers & Tests |
| 3 | 🔴 `E-01`, 🟡 `G-11`, 🟡 `G-12`, 🟢 `G-13`, 🟡 `G-15` | `E-01` → 🔬 SPIKE-01 | ⚙️ Complex Operations · 🧪 Field Resolvers & Tests |
| 4 | 🟡 `G-16` | — | 🧪 Field Resolvers & Tests |

**Critical path:** `B-01` → `D-02` → `E-01` → `G-16` — 4 sequential stories; everything else hangs off this chain in parallel.

## Recommended Story Graph — 2 Backend Engineers

> The order map above assumes unlimited parallelism; this packs the **same dependency graph onto 2 backend engineers** (greedy critical-chain scheduling, nominal day-ranges from complexity — confirm in refinement). Read each column top-to-bottom as one engineer's queue; ⏳ marks a slot that waits on a dependency, 🔬/⛔ are entry gates that slide a slot without reshuffling the lanes.

**Elapsed (nominal midpoints):** ~40 working days with 2 engineers vs ~76 days sequential.

## Jira Stories by Phase

> Each row is one Jira story. Complexity drives T-shirt sizing in refinement. `Depends On` lists blocking story IDs within this domain — including Phase 0 spikes where a story's implementation is gated on a spike's outcome.

Full type list: be-03-schema.graphql. **This scaffold is a prerequisite for every B/C/D/G story** — they need the module + schema file to compile their DGS wrapper — so it is assumed globally (shown once in the dependency graph) and **not repeated** in each story's `Depends On`.
